# Email Template Updates

## Updates Implemented
1. **Font Family Update**:
     - **Headings**: Updated to the "Reckless" font family, providing a bold and distinctive look.
     - **Body Text**: Updated to the "Accord" font family, enhancing readability and aligning with our brand identity.


2. **Consistent Module Spacing**:
   - **Previous Issue**: Inconsistent spacing across different modules.
   - **Update**: Spacing is now standardized across all modules for a more uniform and professional appearance.


3. **Simplified Call-to-Action (CTA) Module**:
   - **Previous Issue**: Multiple CTA modules with varied alignment options.
   - **Update**: Consolidated to a single CTA module where alignment can be defined as left, right, or center. This simplification reduces complexity in the MKTO module element list.


4. **Enhanced CTA Button Design**:
   - **Update**: Added a border radius to CTA buttons for a modern look. This rounded design is visible in updated Outlook desktop and mobile versions, while older versions will display the traditional square buttons.


5. **Background Color Update**:
   - **Update**: Updated the background colors of various modules to align with our latest brand guidelines, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing template.
