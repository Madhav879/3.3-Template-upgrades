 ## Update: Font Family
 ### Overview:
 As per our new brand guidelines, the font family of headings and body text has been updated to "Reckless" and "Accord" respectively. This update will be applied to all landing pages created using the latest template. There is no need to add a font-family externally as it will be fetched automatically.

 ## New Feature: Conditional Section BG classes.
 ### Overview:
 To ensure consistency with our brand guidelines, we have introduced automatic font color setting for sections in our landing pages. When specific background color classes are applied to a section, the font color will be automatically set to comply with our brand guidelines. Additionally, if a developer attempts to change the font color using inline styling, the script will check if the color is valid for the background and reset it if necessary.

### How It Works
* When a CSS class associated with one of the specified background colors is applied to a section, the font color will be automatically set to comply with our brand guidelines.

* If a developer tries to change the font color using inline styling, the script will check if the color is valid for the background and reset it if necessary.

### Available Section Classes and Colors:
* **.section-bg-white**: Background color White, font color Onyx or Midnight Blue.
* **.section-bg-darkblue**: Background color Midnight Blue, font color White, Horizon Blue, or Ice Blue.
* **.section-bg-snowblue**: Background color Snow Blue, font color Onyx or Midnight Blue.
* **.section-bg-iceblue**: Background color Ice Blue, font color Onyx or Midnight Blue.
* **.section-bg-cyan**: Background color Horizon Blue, font color Onyx or Midnight Blue.
* **.section-bg-green**: Background color Fresh Green, font color Onyx or Midnight Blue.
* **.section-bg-gold**: Background color Honey Gold, font color Onyx or Midnight Blue.
* **.section-bg-purple**: Background color Orchid Purple, font color White.

### Brand Guideline Colors
* **Horizon Blue**: #00B7F1
* **White**: #FFFFFF
* **Midnight Blue**: #000E4E
* **Fresh Green**: #81BB41
* **Ice Blue**: #BFEDFC
* **Orchid Purple**: #993399
* **Honey Gold**: #F4BE03

 ## New Feature: Automatic Button Styling for ``<a>`` Tags
 ### Overview
The ``<a>`` tags used to create buttons inside the sections will be automatically styled to a button that is valid to use with the specific background color class. This feature eliminates the need for developers to manually add class names or inline styles to the ``<a>`` tags for styling.

* Certain class names like "video-popup" and "zenith-guarded" serve specific purposes and are acceptable.

* If you are linking an image, you should add the "thumbnail" class to the ``<a>`` tag, as shown in the example below.  

```html
<a href="#" class="thumbnail">
    <img src="#" alt="#">
</a>
```

## Adding Icons to Buttons

To include icons on a button, simply add the corresponding icon class to the `<a>` tag.

### Available Icons and Usage Guidelines

Currently we have six types of icons, each serving a different purpose:

- **New Window Icon** <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="20px" viewBox="0 -960 960 960" width="22px" fill="#00B7F1" style="vertical-align: middle;"><path d="M200-120q-33 0-56.5-23.5T120-200v-560q0-33 23.5-56.5T200-840h240v80H200v560h560v-240h80v240q0 33-23.5 56.5T760-120H200Zm440-400v-120H520v-80h120v-120h80v120h120v80H720v120h-80Z"/></svg> : Use this when the URL opens in a new tab or window.
- **Right Arrow Icon**: This icon is for links that open in the same page, without opening a new tab.
- **Chat Now Icon**: Commonly used for a "Chat Now" button.
- **Chat Later Icon**: Typically used for actions that can be deferred, like a "Contact Us" button.
- **Video Play Icon**: Use this for buttons that directly open a video in a modal. **Do not** use it for links that lead to a different page containing a video.
- **Download Icon**: Only use this for buttons that directly download a file. **Do not** use it for links that lead to a page with downloads.

### Adding the Icon Class

Include the appropriate class name inside the `<a>` tag based on the icon type.

### Icon Class Names:
- `new-window`
- `right-arrow`
- `chat-now`
- `chat-later`
- `video-play`
- `download`
  
**Please note that the icons will not appear in the Marketo editor; they will show up on the live page.**

### Example Code:

```html
<a href="" class="new-window">Learn More</a>
```
 

 ## New Feature: Mobile Responsive Backgrounds
 ### Overview
 To enhance the legibility of content on mobile devices, we have introduced a new feature that provides fallback background colors for sections. These fallback background colors are based on the section BG class assigned during page development.

 ### Why We Implemented This Feature
 * **Improved Legibility**: On mobile devices, section background images may not always be fully visible, affecting the legibility of content.
* **Enhanced User Experience**: To ensure a consistent and legible viewing experience across all devices, we have introduced this feature.

### How It Works
**1. Desktop and Larger Screens:**
* The background image is displayed as usual.
* The image is fully visible, providing the intended visual appeal.

**2. Mobile Devices:**
* The background image is disabled to avoid readability issues.
* A background color is applied instead, based on the CSS class assigned to the section.
### Benefits
* **Improved Readability**: Ensures that content remains easily readable on mobile devices, even if the section background image is not fully visible.
* **Consistent User Experience**: Provides a consistent viewing experience across all devices, enhancing user satisfaction.
